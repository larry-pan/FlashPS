# Artifact Evaluation for Eurosys 2026
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to reproduce the experiments and results presented in our Flashps paper. Follow these steps to validate our major claims regarding **performance improvements** and **image quality preservation**.

To simplify reproducibility, we provide an off-the-shelf Docker image, `jiangxiaoxiao/flashps` which includes all the dependencies and configurations required to run the experiments. This eliminates the need for complex environment setup. 
We also provide an AWS EC2 instance with **A10 GPUs**.
Please comment on us in the HotCRP with your public key to get the IP address and access the machine.
### Docker and Environment Setup
You can refer to these commands to build the Docker environment and set up the conda environment. First, use the image `pytorch/pytorch:2.5.1-cuda12.4-cudnn9-devel` as the base image, then configure the conda environment within this image.


```bash
# Create conda env
conda create -n flashps python=3.10
conda activate flashps
# Git clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/Sylvia-16/FlashPS.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Install our customized diffusers package
cd diffusers && pip install -e .
```

### Run FlashPS with Docker
We have pulled the image on the provided machine, as its size is nearly 100 GiB.
```bash
# We will add your public key to the machine. You can log in to the machine with your private key by replacing the <IP_ADDRESS> with the actual IP.
ssh ubuntu@<IP_ADDRESS>

# We have pulled the image on the provided machine. You can skip this. On your machine, you can pull the prebuilt Docker image with the following command.
docker pull jiangxiaoxiao/flashps:latest

# Clear the stopped container, if it exists
docker kill flashps-ae
docker rm flashps-ae

# Run the following command to spin up the container. This may take a few minutes.
docker run -d --name flashps-ae --runtime=nvidia --gpus all --shm-size=16g \
-e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all -e CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 \
-e CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV="" \
-e CONDA_AUTO_ACTIVATE_BASE=false \
jiangxiaoxiao/flashps sleep infinity

docker exec -it flashps-ae zsh

# Activate the environment
conda activate flashps

```

### End-to-end Performance of OOTD
```bash
cd /app/image-inpainting/scheduler/

# Ensure the repo up-to-date
git pull

# Spin up the server to test TeaCache and diffusers baseline. It may take two minutes to start the server.
# When the server successfully starts, it will print
# "INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8005 (Press CTRL+C to quit)"
# on the console.

bash run_server_ootd_no_cb.sh

# Send requests to the server. Note that the first 10 requests are for warm-up purposes.
# For each baseline, we send requests with different RPS. 

# Send requests to evaluate the baseline TeaCache.
bash /app/image-inpainting/scheduler/test_ootd_teacache.sh

# Send requests to evaluate the baseline diffusers.
bash /app/image-inpainting/scheduler/test_ootd_diffusers.sh

# Remember to kill the server.
bash kill_server.sh

# Spin up the server to test FlashPS baseline. It may take two minutes to start the server.
# When the server successfully starts, it will print
# "INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8005 (Press CTRL+C to quit)"
# on the console.

bash run_server_ootd.sh

# Send requests to evaluate FlashPS.
bash /app/image-inpainting/scheduler/test_ootd_flashps.sh

# Remember to kill the server.
bash kill_server.sh

# Analyze and plot the results. The script will print out the path to the figure.
python scripts/parse_end2end.py

```
You may compare the figure with Figure 12 in the paper.

### Image Quality Assessment
Our image quality evaluation ensures that **performance optimizations** do not compromise **output quality**. 
As generating all images takes hours, we have cached them for evaluation.

Evaluate Image Quality. This may take minutes.
```
cd /app/image-inpainting/
bash scripts/test_quality.sh 
```
You may compare the printed results with those in Table 2 in the paper.


### End-to-end Performance of SD2
As FISEdit requires a customized environment to execute, we have preconfigured the environment to evaluate the performance of SD2 directly on the machine (not using a Docker container). We configured the FISEdit environment following this link: https://github.com/Hankpipi/diffusers-hetu. The `hetu.exp` mentioned later in the script is the inference engine used by FISEdit.
Please log out and re-log in to the machine for the following evaluation.

```bash
ssh ubuntu@<IP_ADDRESS>

# Then stay on the machine, without the need to use a Docker container.
```


```bash
# Initialize the environment
source activate pytorch

# Go to the project directory
cd /home/ubuntu/image-inpainting/scheduler

# Spin up the server to evaluate FlashPS. It may take two minutes to start the server.
# When the server successfully starts, it will print
# "INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8005 (Press CTRL+C to quit)"
# on the console.
bash run_server_sd2_cb.sh

# Send requests to evaluate FlashPS.
bash scripts/test_cb_sd2.sh

# kill the server
bash scripts/kill_gpu_processes.sh


# Spin up the server to evaluate Diffusers. It may take two minutes to start the server.
# When the server successfully starts, it will print
# "INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8005 (Press CTRL+C to quit)"
# on the console.
bash run_server_sd2_no_cb.sh

# Send requests to evaluate Diffusers.
bash scripts/test_no_cb_sd2.sh

# kill the server
bash scripts/kill_gpu_processes.sh

# activate fisedit environment
conda activate fisedit
source ~/Hetu/hetu.exp

# Spin up the server to evaluate FisEdit. It may take two minutes to start the server.
# When the server successfully starts, it will print
# "INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8005 (Press CTRL+C to quit)"
# on the console.
bash run_server_fisedit_no_cb.sh

# Send requests to evaluate FisEdit.
bash scripts/test_fisedit_e2e.sh

# kill the server
bash scripts/kill_gpu_processes.sh

# analyze and plot the result. The script will print out the path to the figure.
python scripts/parse_end2end.py 

```
You may compare the figure with Figure 12 in the paper.

### Distribution of Mask Ratios

In the same machine, which is used to evaluate SD2. 
```bash
# Go to the trace directory
cd /home/ubuntu/plot_mask_ratio

# Plot the distribution
python3 plot_mask_ratio_2traces.py
```
You may compare the plot /home/ubuntu/plot_mask_ratio/mask_ratio_2traces.pdf with the Figure 3 in the paper.
